Startup founder
───────────────

  2011 Oct to 2016 Dec

  *Wilfredo’s Ice Cream Company*

  2015-2016 Bruce also handled the end of year AFS and guided the
  direction of the business.

  2012-2014 With business partner, we manufactured ice cream and
  delivered it.
  Bruce administered the business. He issued invoices, handled incoming
  invoices, made payments, updated the books and handled the VAT.

  2011 Performed product R&D and researched manufacture and delivery
  options. Also researched a ﬁnancial reporting system.

  Bruce spent his free time building a spreadsheet model to anticipate
  cashflow and profitability of the business. To this end he discovered
  a difficulty with future cashflow that only a very deep pocket and
  phenomenal sales growth could overcome. This was met with sheer
  disbelief by his partner. But as the prognosis of the model started
  coming true and in light of the insightful information provided by the
  model, further equity capital was withheld and lossess of up to
  R15million were nipped in the bud.
