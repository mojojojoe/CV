\section{PROJECTS}
\label{sec:org1460efc}

\subsection{Costing and Profit spreadsheet - Wilfredo’s Ice Cream Co.}
\label{sec:org3e3ff16}

This spreadsheet was built to ascertain how much the business should
charge for its ice cream. It tied in with the company’s finances to show proﬁt, from input costs of the ice cream, ongoing expenses, and cost price charged. Ultimately it gave the managers insight into the sustainability of the ice cream business model and substantial amounts of money by showing that ultimately
the business wasn’t sustainable.

\subsection{Home budget spreadsheet tool}
\label{sec:org4d28362}

Bruce designed a home budget tool to keep track of expenses and show deviations in a tight household budget. This can be adapted for business use. The next step is to code all the concepts and ultimately to tie it in to an R or Julia package so that everyone can use it.

\subsection{Investment analysis scripted document}
\label{sec:org3cf5ab1}

Bruce wrote an experimental org script in Emacs to pull stock prices oﬀ the internet, and to reﬂect the valuations on investments. Bruce further incorporated exchange rates. Bruce stored crucial values to a Sqlite3 database and charted the continuously updated data with a time series chart from R. He has also converted some of the code to R and is performing optimisations on portfolios with some of the specialist packages in R (FRAPO, Quantmod, fPortfolio).

\subsection{Media monitoring analysis}
\label{sec:org0ed7948}
Bruce developed a spreadsheet analytic tool that enabled a PR consultant to accurately monitor and analyse the spread, volume and value of media coverage received for her clients.
