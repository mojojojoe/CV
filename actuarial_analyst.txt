6.1 Costing and Profit spreadsheet - Wilfredo’s Ice Cream Co.

  This spreadsheet was built to ascertain how much the business should
  charge for its ice cream. It tied in with the company’s finances to
  show proﬁt, from input costs of the ice cream, ongoing expenses, and
  cost price charged. Ultimately it gave the managers insight into the
  sustainability of the ice cream business model and substantial amounts
  of money by showing that ultimately the business wasn’t sustainable.
