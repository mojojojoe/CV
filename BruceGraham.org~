* PROJECTS

Costing and Profit spreadsheet (Wilfredo’s Ice Cream Co.):
This spreadsheet was built to ascertain how much the business had to charge for its ice cream. It tied in with the Wilfredo’s Ice Cream company’s finances to show proﬁt from input costs of the ice cream, ongoing expenses, and cost price charged. Ultimately it gave the managers insight into the sustainability of the ice cream business model and saved tens of millions of rands by showing that ultimately the business wasn’t sustainable.

Home budget spreadsheet tool:
Bruce designed a home budget tool to keep track of expenses and show where deviations in a tight household budget were happening. This can be adapted to a business use. The next step is to code all the concepts and ultimately to tie it into an R or Julia package so that everyone can use it.

Investment analysis scripted document:
Bruce wrote an experimental org script in Emacs to pull stock prices oﬀ the internet, and to reﬂect the valuations on investments. He further incorporated exchange rates. Bruce stored crucial values to a Sqlite3 database and charted the continuously updated data with a time series chart from R. Latterly he has converted some of the code to R and is performing optimisations on portfolio’s with some of the specialist packages in R.

* WORK EXPERIENCE

Personal investment manager				2017-present
Work from home
Bruce conducts research and reading on the markets and economy. Based on research, Bruce picks equities with an eye to harnessing ultra long term market forces and trends. He timeously purchased into a Euro based resource ETF before the Bloomberg announcement of a new commodity supercycle. Bruce timeously purchased global REITs in anticipation of a highly inflationary environment. Mistake wise, Bruce sold shares in the KOMP 4th IR tech fund only half way through their rise. Bruce is a connoisseur of investment products with good research and excellent risk management. He has latterly invested in a global equity multi factor fund and is no longer exclusively a return chaser.
