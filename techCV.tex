\section{WORK EXPERIENCE}
\label{sec:org1258646}

Personal investment manager				[2017-01-31
Work from home
Bruce conducts research and reading on the markets and economy. Based on research, Bruce picks equities with an eye to harnessing ultra long term market forces and trends. He timeously purchased into a Euro based resource ETF before the Bloomberg announcement of a new commodity supercycle. Bruce timeously purchased global REITs in anticipation of a highly inflationary environment. Mistake wise, Bruce sold shares in the KOMP 4th IR tech fund only half way through their rise. Bruce is a connoisseur of investment products with good research and excellent risk management. He has latterly invested in a global equity multi factor fund and is no longer exclusively a return chaser.

Entrepreneur   		                             April 2008-July 2015
Wilfredo’s Ice Cream Company
Bruce performed product R\&D and established a factory. He also researched a ﬁnancial reporting system and performed the bookkeeping. With his business partner, they produced ice cream and delivered it. Bruce administered the business and guided the direction of the business, spending his free time building a spreadsheet model to anticipate cashflow and profitability of the business.

Entrepreneur  		                             Sep 2006-Jan 2008

Bruce was involved in the pilot phase of this business. He scoured the surrounding mountains for antennae sights. He lobbied the municipality for support. He canvassed the area for customers and lobbied for business. Bruce formed a partnership with a company in George to perform the technical setup. Bruce left after having secured the first few customers.
