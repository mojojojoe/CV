__PROJECTS__
*Costing and Profit spreadsheet - Wilfredo’s Ice Cream Co.*
  This spreadsheet was built to ascertain how much the business should
  charge for its ice cream. It tied in with the company’s finances to
  show profit, from input costs of the ice cream, ongoing expenses, and
  cost price charged. Ultimately it gave the managers insight into the
  sustainability of the ice cream business model and substantial amounts
  of money by showing that ultimately the business wasn’t sustainable.

*Home budget spreadsheet tool*
  Bruce designed a home budget tool to keep track of expenses and show
  deviations in a tight household budget. This can be adapted for
  business use. The next step is to code all the concepts and ultimately
  to tie it in to an R or Julia package so that everyone can use it.

*Investment analysis scripted document*
  Bruce wrote an experimental org script in Emacs to pull stock prices
  off the internet, and to reflect the valuations on investments. Bruce
  further incorporated exchange rates. Bruce stored crucial values to a
  Sqlite3 database and charted the continuously updated data with a time
  series chart from R. He has also converted some of the code to R and
  is performing optimisations on portfolios with some of the specialist
  packages in R (FRAPO, Quantmod, fPortfolio).

*Media monitoring analysis*
  Bruce developed a spreadsheet analytic tool that enabled a PR
  consultant to accurately monitor and analyse the spread, volume and
  value of media coverage received for her clients.
