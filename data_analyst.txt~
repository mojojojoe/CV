6 PROJECTS
══════════

  • Costing and Profit spreadsheet (Wilfredo’s Ice Cream Co.):This
    spreadsheet was built to ascertain how much the business had to
    charge for its ice cream. It tied in with the Wilfredo’s Ice Cream
    company’s finances to show proﬁt from input costs of the ice cream,
    ongoing expenses, and cost price charged. Ultimately it gave the
    managers insight into the sustainability of the ice cream business
    model and saved tens of millions of rands by showing that ultimately
    the business wasn’t sustainable.
  • Home budget spreadsheet tool: Bruce designed a home budget tool to
    keep track of expenses and show where deviations in a tight
    household budget were happening. This can be adapted to a business
    use. The next step is to code all the concepts and ultimately to tie
    it into an R or Julia package so that everyone can use it.
  • Investment analysis scripted document: Bruce wrote an experimental
    org script in Emacs to pull stock prices oﬀ the internet, and to
    reﬂect the valuations on investments. He further incorporated
    exchange rates. Bruce stored crucial values to a Sqlite3 database
    and charted the continuously updated data with a time series chart
    from R. Latterly he has converted some of the code to R and is
    performing optimisations on portfolio’s with some of the specialist
    packages in R.
